# Belly-Button-Analysis

This project creates an interactive dashboard that explores the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).  You can pick from 153 trial participants to see what types of bacteria are represented in their belly buttons.

The description of the datasets from the Rob Dunn Lab are as follows: Taxonomic data matrix (sheet 1) and meta-data matrix with participant-reported information and derived environmental factors (sheet 2). 153 participants are represented in this data set (same participants as in Interactive Chart 1), including 60 individuals whose data were included in Hulcr et al 2012.
